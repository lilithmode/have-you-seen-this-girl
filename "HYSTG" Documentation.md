### 1/19/25
- finally planned out stuff and wrote it down lol
	- cast finally decided
		- lauren as nun 
		- celadon as angel
	- general plot is as follows:
		- the nun is essentially a big parasocial person, who really wants to connect with this higher deity of some sort.
			- she's also, a bit, well, kind of wild. she can say some of the worst things imaginable. when inebriated.
		- the angel is someone that she sees as holy, pious, pure of heart.
				- representation of denial, a coping mechanism
			- in reality, this is someone who has not thought about "the nun" in ages. the cope has settled in SO HARD that they start relating to them as an angel / religious deity of some sort. maybe it's real, maybe it isn't. fuck them.
### 3 ACT STRUCTURE:
##### ACT I
- talking with angel
	- hide away (accept offer) (1)
	- face fear (reject offer) (2)
##### ACT II
- talk with angel (1)
- confront actual person (2)
##### ACT III
- denial (1) (live but it sucks lol)
-  acceptance (2) (live lol)
### 1.20.26
- happy first day of school lol
	- something that came to mind is i have no idea how i'm going to be organizing these stems -- *do i need to "make" the composition again in quad? or do I export all the stems and run it through supacollider?*
- three compositions that have "routes" will probably be the most reasonable for me to work on like a NUT
- last composition would have the ending route they chose's ending - very simple. nothing secret.
	- ACT I 
		- begrudgingly (intro)
			- the angel descends
		- babble (1)
		- violence against the hands that fed me?! (2)
	- ACT II
		- blahblahblahblah (1)
		- why does it hurt when i talk to you? (2)
	- ACT III
		- fetal once more (1)
		- like beams of light, extended towards the sky (2)
			- the angel ascends (1)
			- the angel leaves (2)
- Fuck. *FUCK.* i gotta do alla this. but i think the scope feels manageable
-  how many tracks is that?  **10?** fuckkkkkk.
	- ending survey would FUCK HARDDDDDD - google forms?

	- how tf do i make this in quad lmao
- i'm going to start writing the script and just letting it happen
	- wrote the climax, the big phone call. lack of angel. now i just have to write around it. 
- have the beginning have the nun talk to the phone booth / angel talking about what she did for her day.
	- make it boring but see that she has a general love for life, but there's something always bothering her around that time.
- sai - is the angel always looking for the nun to be in a negative frame of mind until you do your duties?
