i think i deserve a 100!

i was able to really think about my schedule and make sure that i hold myself accountable to all of these things that are upcoming.

rather than worrying about juries, i just want to make sure i have enough time to debug and test out everything that i need to in order to make sure this installation goes smoothly.

i organized it in the sense where a lot of the work will be done @ the beginning, but would be just the right amount of complete for juries. 

afterwards, the rest is literally just debugging, testing, and mixing and mastering the whole thing not just for the installation, but for release on my own artist page. i also made sure to give myself time near the end so that way i won't be overwhelmed with the work (as much lol).
